# Welcome to Sidekiq 7.0!

Sidekiq 7.0 contains some breaking changes which streamline proper operation
of Sidekiq. It completes the transition from the `redis` gem to the `redis-client`
gem, which adds support for the RESP3 protocol and provides better compatibility
with future versions of Redis.

## What's New

### redis-client

Sidekiq 6.5 introduced beta support for the `redis-client` gem while defaulting to
using the `redis` gem. Sidekiq 7.0 completes this transition and no longer uses
the `redis` gem internally. **Your app can still continue to use `redis`.** If you use `Sidekiq.redis` to access Redis connections, that API is now exposing a connection based on `redis-client`.

### redis-namespace

Support for `redis-namespace` has been removed. [I have advised against its usage for many years now.](https://www.mikeperham.com/2017/04/10/migrating-from-redis-namespace/) One option is to use Redis's numbered databases instead.

## Version Support

- Redis 6.2+ is now required
- Ruby 2.7+ is now required
- Rails 6.0+ is now supported

Support is only guaranteed for the current and previous major versions. With the release of Sidekiq 7, Sidekiq 5.x is no longer supported.

## Upgrade

As always, please upgrade Sidekiq **one major version at a time**.
If you are already running Sidekiq 6.x, then:

* Upgrade to the latest Sidekiq 6.x.
```ruby
gem 'sidekiq', '< 7'
```
* Fix any deprecation warnings you see.
* Upgrade to 7.x.
```ruby
gem 'sidekiq', '< 8'
```
