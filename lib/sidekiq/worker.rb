  # Include this module in your worker class and you can easily create
  # asynchronous jobs:
  #
  # class HardWorker
  #   include Sidekiq::Worker
  #
  #   def perform(*args)
  #     # do some work
  #   end
  # end
  #
  # Then in your Rails app, you can do this:
  #
  #   HardWorker.perform_async(1, 2, 3)
  #
  # Note that perform_async is a class method, perform is an instance method.
